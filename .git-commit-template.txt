# <type>: <what changed> [scope]
#
# Examples:
# wip: tune crater threshold [scoring]
# feat: add UNet inference pass [model]
# fix: handle empty masks [eval]
# perf: reduce GPU memory usage [docker]
# chore: update submission format [topcoder]
#
# lists of type:
# wip     = experiment / checkpoint
# feat    = new model, pipeline, or logic
# fix     = bug or correctness issue
# perf    = speed or memory improvement
# eval    = scoring / metrics / validation
# data    = data prep (no raw data committed)
# model   = model architecture / weights logic
# docker  = Dockerfile / environment
# submit  = submission-ready checkpoint
# chore   = configs, README, cleanup
